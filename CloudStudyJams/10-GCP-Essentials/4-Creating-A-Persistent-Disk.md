### 1. ```QWIKLABS USAGE```

The _Connection Details_ side panel has three pieces of information:
 
 - Username
 - Password
 - GCP Project ID

These get populated when you click "Start Lab". They provide temporary credentials and a preset project IDs for doing labs. Recommended process:

 1. Open an anonymous browser to do exercises
 2. Log into Google Cloud Platform using these credentials
 3. Once logged in, make sure the "Project ID" reflects the ID provided
 4. Do not sign up for any free trials or recovery options during login
