# Setup Network and HTTP Load Balancers

### 1. ```QWIKLABS USAGE```

The _Connection Details_ side panel has three pieces of information:
 
 - Username
 - Password
 - GCP Project ID

These get populated when you click "Start Lab". They provide temporary credentials and a preset project IDs for doing labs. Recommended process:

 1. Open an anonymous browser to do exercises
 2. Log into Google Cloud Platform using these credentials
 3. Once logged in, make sure the "Project ID" reflects the ID provided
 4. Do not sign up for any free trials or recovery options during login


### 2. ```OVERVIEW```
In this hands-on lab, you'll learn the differences between a network load balancer and a HTTP load balancer, and how to set them up for your applications running on Google Compute Engine virtual machines.

There are two types of load balancers in Google Cloud Platform:

L3 Network Load Balancer
L7 HTTP(s) Load Balancer
This labs will take you through the steps to setup both types of load balancers.

### 3. ```WHAT YOU'LL LEARN```

There are [two types of load balancers in Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing-and-autoscaling#network_load_balancing):

L3 [Network Load Balancer](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/network/)
L7 [HTTP(s) Load Balancer](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/http/)
This labs will take you through the steps to setup both types of load balancers.

### 4. ```WHAT YOU'LL DO```

 * Setup a network load balancer.
 * Setup a HTTP(s) load balancer
 * Get hands-on experience learning the differences between network load balancers and HTTP load balancers.
